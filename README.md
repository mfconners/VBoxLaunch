# Introduction
This is based on a similar program by [Nic Bedford](http://nicbedford.co.uk/software/vboxlaunch/).  It stopped working on my computer.  Nic doesn't use it any more and had lost the source code.  So I re-wrote it.

# Installation
1. You need .Net v4.
2. [Download](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs.git) or build the program.
3. Copy VBoxLaunch.exe into a directory.
4. Create a shortcut to the program.
5. Put the shortcut in a place where your Start menu can see it.
6. Run the program to populate the jump list.
7. Enjoy!

# Bugs
It works, but I haven't tested it extensively.  If you have issues, let me know at [VBoxLaunch Issues](https://github.com/mfconners/VBoxLaunch/issues).
